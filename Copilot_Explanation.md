This code defines a Streamlit web application called "Stock Assistant" that helps users discover and analyze the top 3 trending US stock tickers for the week. The app integrates several modern tools: it uses TavilySearch to fetch real-time trending stock tickers from the web, and the Groq LLM (via LangChain) to generate insightful, human-readable summaries for each ticker. 

The script begins by loading environment variables and setting up caching for efficient LLM responses. It initializes the Groq LLM with a specific model and parameters, and prepares the TavilySearch tool for web queries. The function `get_top_3_tickers` sends a query to TavilySearch, parses the results to extract likely stock ticker symbols (using a simple filter for uppercase, short words), and returns the top three unique tickers. The `get_stock_insights` function takes a ticker symbol and prompts the LLM to generate a concise markdown-formatted report, including recent news, social media trends, and market analysis.

The Streamlit UI presents a clean interface with a title, subtitle, and sidebar description. When the user clicks the "Get Top 3 Trending Tickers This Week" button, the app fetches the tickers, displays each one, and shows the generated insights below it. If no tickers are found, a warning is displayed. This approach provides users with up-to-date stock trends and AI-generated analysis in a single, interactive dashboard.
